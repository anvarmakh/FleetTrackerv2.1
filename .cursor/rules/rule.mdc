Need to use camelcase for all javascript files - both frontend and backend. If there is any disruption fix it in a way so the style of camelcase is followed. File names should not strcitly follow CamelCase rule, its applicable to variables and functions.
Snakecase should be kept exclusively for database columns
Translation from the styles is implemented in database utils
SuperAdmin is system administrator, not an organization role within a tenant
Database is splited into managers maintaining separate tasks

Clean test files after test completed 
Logic should be as flexible for all scenarios of system utilization as possible
While creating new layout and design or any other attribute of frontend, please check /ui folder if such attribute is already developed. Dark mode UI should be respected as well
