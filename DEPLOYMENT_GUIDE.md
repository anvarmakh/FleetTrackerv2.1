# üöÇ FleetTracker v2.1 - Complete Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to deploy your FleetTracker application to Railway, including security considerations and admin access.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **Environment Variables**: Prepare your production environment variables

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your FleetTracker repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js project

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to the "Variables" tab and add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables (Production)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-character-encryption-key
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-refresh-secret
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-64-character-admin-key
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` is used for system administrator access. Generate a strong, unique key and never share it.

#### Optional Variables
```bash
DEFAULT_TENANT_ID=default
DEFAULT_TENANT_NAME=Your Organization Name
DEFAULT_TENANT_DESCRIPTION=Your organization description
GPS_SYNC_INTERVAL=300
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token
```

### 3. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically build and deploy your application
2. The build process will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Build the frontend (React/Vite)
   - Start the backend server
3. Your app will be available at the provided Railway URL

## üîß Configuration Files

The following files have been created for Railway deployment:

### `railway.json`
- Railway-specific configuration
- Health check endpoint: `/api/health`
- Restart policy configuration

### `nixpacks.toml`
- Build configuration for Railway
- Specifies Node.js and npm installation
- Defines build and start commands

### `Procfile`
- Process management for Railway
- Specifies the web process command

### `env.example`
- Template for environment variables
- Copy to `.env` for local development

## üè• Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that returns:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "system": "GPS Fleet Management with DOT Tenancy (Refactored)",
  "version": "2.4.0",
  "features": {
    "multiTenant": true,
    "dotTenancy": true,
    "autoDiscovery": true,
    "encryption": true,
    "authentication": true,
    "persistentTrailers": true,
    "gpsProviders": ["spireon", "skybitz", "samsara"],
    "modularArchitecture": true
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Security
1. **Change Default Secrets**: Update all default secrets in production
2. **Use Strong Keys**: Generate secure random keys for:
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 characters)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (64+ characters)
   - `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (64+ characters)
   - `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` (64+ characters) - **CRITICAL for admin access**

### Admin Access Security
- **Admin Email**: `admin@system.local` (fixed)
- **Admin Password**: Your `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` value
- **Security**: Admin credentials are validated only on the backend
- **Monitoring**: All admin access is logged and monitored

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use Railway's environment variable management
- Rotate secrets regularly

## üîë Admin Access Guide

### How Admin Access Works

1. **Frontend**: Only detects admin email (`admin@system.local`)
2. **Backend**: Validates the admin key against environment variable
3. **Security**: No credentials stored in frontend code

### Admin Login Process

#### Step 1: Frontend Detection
```typescript
// Only checks for admin email, no password validation
if (email === 'admin@system.local') {
  await adminLogin(password); // Sends password to backend for validation
}
```

#### Step 2: Backend Validation
```javascript
// Backend validates against environment variable
const validAdminKey = config.admin.secretKey; // From ADMIN_SECRET_KEY env var
if (adminKey !== validAdminKey) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid admin key' });
}
```

### Admin Login Credentials
- **Email**: `admin@system.local` (fixed)
- **Password**: Your `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` value
- **Validation**: Backend only

### Strong Admin Key Generation
```bash
# Generate a secure admin key
openssl rand -base64 48
# or
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- Monitor application logs in real-time
- Track resource usage (CPU, memory)
- View deployment history

### Application Logs
- Backend logs are available in Railway dashboard
- Frontend build logs are shown during deployment
- Error logs are automatically captured

### Admin Access Monitoring
```javascript
// Admin login successful
logger.warn('Admin login successful - monitor this access', { tokenId });

// Using default key in production
logger.error('Using default admin key in production - security risk!');
```

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your main branch:

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Railway detects the changes
3. Automatic build and deployment
4. Health check verification
5. Traffic routing to new deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Review build logs in Railway dashboard

#### Runtime Errors
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify database connection (if using external DB)
- Review application logs

#### Health Check Failures
- Ensure the `/api/health` endpoint is accessible
- Check that the server is starting correctly
- Verify port configuration

#### Admin Login Fails
1. Check `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` is set in Railway
2. Verify the key matches what you're entering
3. Check application logs for errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View build logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Restart deployment
railway service restart
```

## üìà Scaling

### Automatic Scaling
- Railway automatically scales based on traffic
- No manual configuration required
- Pay only for what you use

### Manual Scaling
- Adjust resources in Railway dashboard
- Scale up for high traffic periods
- Scale down during low usage

## üîó Custom Domains

1. Go to your Railway project settings
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS records
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Railway)

## üö® Security Warnings

### Before Deployment
```bash
# Check if using default admin key
grep -r "dev-admin-key-change-in-production" .

# Should return NO results in production
```

### Environment Variable Check
```bash
# Verify admin key is set
echo $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY

# Should NOT be empty or default value
```
